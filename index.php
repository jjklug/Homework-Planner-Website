                    <p><strong>This website will make college simple!</strong> From blackboard to outlook to teams, professors are using all different applications and programs to keep in touch with us these days. Sometimes it is hard to keep track of all our assignments when we are switching between platforms for every single class we have. That is why we created this website! We want to help out the students at UVM by providing them a resource that will allow them to have all their homework assignments for any given week in one location.</p>
