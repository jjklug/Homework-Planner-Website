# Homework-Planner-Website

This repository contains all of the files used to create the website @ https://bksoucy.w3.uvm.edu/final/index.php

This website is designed to be a homework planner for students in school. It contains an entry tab and you can submit all of the information for your homwework assignment. It is meant to be a basic experiment with website creation using basic elements of html for structure, css for design, and sql for data entry/storage.

The MySQL database is used to store the homework information submitted. That data is then accessed and output in a nice format for the user on the display tab of the website.

The website also contains a survey tab so users can enter reccomendations and complaints about the website. This is all stored in the database and can be accessed on the back end.
